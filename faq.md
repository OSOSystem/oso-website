### Isn't this already possible?
You can use devices which can make emergency calls.
Or you can use your smartphone.
But what about when you want to inform several people?
Seems kinda tedious and time consuming. Especially in situations where time is scarce.

### How to use it?
You need an device which should support GSM and GPRS. GPS would be ideal but not a must have.
The device should be programmable so we can connect it with our service.

### How does it work?
When you are emitting an emergency our backend will receive it.
It tries to identify you, so it can distribute it to the persons which you've listed.
Your listed helpers are then getting notified via our app.

### Am I being tracked?
As the name OSO already suggests it is every component of this project open source. 
We only save the data which is needed for this service to work. 
There always will be transparency.
