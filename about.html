<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  We are three students named Dennis, Pierre and Valentino who started with the OSO project.
  Currently we are studying computer science in TH KÃ¶ln in Germany.

  OSO was an idea of ours which emerged during a project assignment.
  It was important to us that our project should have a social character.
  Furthermore we liked the idea that the project is technically a challenge.
