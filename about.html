<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  We are three students named Dennis, Pierre and Valentino who started with the OSO project. <br/>
  Currently we are studying computer science at the TH KÃ¶ln / University of Applied Sciences Cologne, in Germany.<br/><br/>

  OSO was an idea of ours which emerged during a project assignment.
  It was important to us that our project should have a social character.
  Furthermore we liked the idea that the project is technically a challenge.
