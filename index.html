          Sometimes you are not that clearheaded as you may think. Especially when adrenalin rushes through your blood.
          Knowing you can inform someone by just pressing a button to inform them about your whereabouts is reassuring and will reduce the stress.

          Companies who built such devices often provide a platform to list a person who will get notified in case of an emergency.
          These tools and platforms are often too limited though.
          They only let you list one contact, don't let you adjust the channel where you will receive a notification and you don't even know what will happen with your data.
          There is no real standard since everyone is providing their own solution.
