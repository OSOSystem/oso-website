          Sometimes you are not that clearheaded as you may think. Especially when adrenalin is flowing through your blood.

          Companies who built such devices often provide a platform to list a person which get notified in case of an emergency.
          These tools and platforms are often too limited though.
          For example they only let you list one contact,
          don't let you adjust the channel where you will receive a notification and the list goes on and on.

          There is no real standard as everyone is providing their own solution.
