### What is this project about?
Have you ever been or do you know someone who was in a situation where it would have been handy to tell people about your location?
What if I told you that this whole process can be done by just clicking a button on a smart device?
Sounds cool? Then keep reading.

### Meaning of OSO
OSO stands for Open Source Ortungssystem. 
The last word Ortungssystem is german and translated means locating system.

#### Isn't this already possible?
You can use devices which can emit emergencies.
Or you can use your smartphone to write a message or make a call.
But what about when you want to inform several people?
Seems kinda tedious and time consuming. Especially in situations where time is scarce.

#### Existing solutions
Companies who built such devices often provide a platform to list a person which get notified in case of an emergency.
These tools and platforms are often too limited though. 
For example they only let you list one contact, 
don't let you adjust the channel where you will receive a notification and the list goes on and on.

There is no real standard as everyone is providing their own solution.

### Feeling safe
Sometimes you are not that clearheaded as you may think. Especially when adrenalin is flowing through your blood. 
Maybe some people have made experiences like that after an car accident for instance.
To reduce the stress knowing you can inform someone by pressing a button, to tell them about your whereabouts is reassuring.

#### I don't want to be tracked!
As the name OSO already suggests it is every component of this project open source. 
We only save the data which is needed for this service to work. 
There always will be transparency. :relaxed:

#### Audience
It is designed in mind that everyone should be able use it.
It might be especially helpful for
* Kids
* People with special needs
* Elder People

### How to use it?
You need an device which should support GSM and GPRS. GPS would be ideal but not a must have.
The device should be programmable so we can connect it with our service.

### How does it work?
When you are emitting an emergency our backend will receive it.
It tries to identify you, so it can distribute it to the persons which you've listed.
Your listed helpers are then getting notified via our app.

### What is coming in the future
We try to build a platform where people in need have a tool to communicate effortlessly about needing help.
We encourage people to work with us so we can provide the best possible experience.
There is a lot more to come in the future. 
To name a few examples
* Support more devices
* Quick responses
